## UCB - CS161 : computer security

this repository will contain all my learning materials for UCB CS161 course, you can check its [official website](https://cs161.org) for more details.

This course is divided into 5 sections:

- Security principles : how to design a secure system
- Memory safety : buffer overflow attack
- Cryptography : symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, MAC, digital signature .........
- Web : SQL, XSS, CSRF .......
- Networking : attacks for each layer 

The shining part of the course is the labs and projects, which will greatly enhance your mastery of the knowledge (See below for more details).

### Resources

- Slides : ppt for each course
- Notes : detailed notes for each section 
- Discussions : TA will go over the key ideas of the week first, then you can practice on some problems.
- Homework : on gradescope
- Labs : there are three labs in total
  - padding oracle : how to make use of the padding oracle to breach the block cryption.
  - a real attack : a real problem countered in the CS61A's exam file releasing
  - networking : packet sniffing, RST TCP, DNS ... ...
- Projects : there are three projects in total 
  - Proj1 : Hack into the VM use buffer overflow attack. You will do some real attacks on the providing virtualbox virtual machine.
  - **Proj2 (warning) :** This is a very code-heavy projects. You will implement a secure file sharing system in Go language. [Here is my implementation and design doc.](https://github.com/PKUFlyingPig/CS161-Project2-SecureFileShareSystem)
  - Proj3 : TBA
