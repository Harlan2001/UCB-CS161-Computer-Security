## UCB - CS161 : computer security

Berkeley Computer System Security course, the course content is divided into five parts:

- Security principles: how to design a secure system

- Memory safety: buffer overflow attack

- Cryptography: symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, MAC, digital signature .........

- Web: SQL-injection, XSS, XSRF .......

- Networking: attacks for each layer

The most impressive part of this class was Project2, which lets you design and implement a secure file-sharing system using the Go language.It took me three whole days to finish this really bad Project, and the total amount of code was over 3k lines.This intensive development process can greatly exercise your ability to design and implement a secure system.
