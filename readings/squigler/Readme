To run this example you must have python installed (tested with version 2.6
and version 2.7), and sqlite (tested with versions 3.6.23.1, version 3.7.4,
3.11.1).

To run the squigler web server:

	python webserver.py

Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080/ for squigler.com.  (You may be able to visit
http://localhost:8080/ , but on some systems that doesn't work, as the
browser tries to find www.localhost.com.)

To edit the database:

	echo .dump | sqlite3 database.sqlite3 > ascii-file

	<edit ascii-file>

	sqlite3
		.read ascii-file
		.backup X.new

and the revised database is in X.new .

The subdirectory sql-injection-demo-output/ contains output captured during
the demo of SQL injection in lecture:

	sql-injection-demo.out		Squigler stdout
	sql-injection-demo.err		Squigler stderr

	sql-injection-network-dump.out	Network traffic as logged by running
					the "Bro" network monitor (per bro.org)
	hdr-dump.bro			The Bro script used to generate the
					network traffic log
